# PICT-Notification-Android-App
Due to traditional notice boards, sometimes students miss out on important notices. To overcome this problem, this Android App has been developed. In this, teachers can provide study material, the event heads can publicize about their events and students can ask their doubts through forum.

PICTonification will serve following purposes:

● Live notifications and real time updates for students based on the activities of their concern.

● Facilitate Teacher Student Communication and sharing of useful materials.

● Allow various Events/Workshop organizers to publicize their events/Workshops.

● Provide a forum for the students to get their quries answered by authentic sources.
